- **Overview:**
  - Definition: Feature toggles (or feature flags) are a software development technique that allow activation or deactivation of features without the need for a traditional software release.
  - Benefits: 
    1. **Experimentation** (*Testing new homepage layout*)
    2. **Customization** (*User-specific themes*)

    4. **GradualRollout** (*Incremental user access to a feature*)
    5. **EmergencyToggle** (*Quickly disabling a problematic feature*)
    6. **A/BTesting** (*Comparing two checkout page designs*)
    7. **Conditions** (*Feature availability based on user role*)
    8. **Adaptability** (*Adjusting app behavior based on user feedback*)
    9. **Flexibility** (*Enabling/disabling specific modules*)
    10. **Feedback** (*Collecting user responses to a new feature*)
    11. **Responsiveness** (*Swiftly addressing critical issues*)

  - let isFeatureSocialSharingEnabled = localStorage.getItem('featureSocialSharing') === 'true';
  - let isFeatureGuestCheckoutEnabled = localStorage.getItem('featureGuestCheckout') === 'true';
  - let isFeaturePremiumSubscriptionEnabled = localStorage.getItem('featurePremiumSubscription') === 'true';
  - let isFeatureOfflineModeEnabled = localStorage.getItem('featureOfflineMode') === 'true';
  - let isFeatureLiveChatSupportEnabled = localStorage.getItem('featureLiveChatSupport') === 'true';
  - let isFeatureDiscountCodesEnabled = localStorage.getItem('featureDiscountCodes') === 'true';
